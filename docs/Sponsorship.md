# Sponsorship Proposal

## Introduction
After the success of previous years, the Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community (MSCC) is organising the third edition of the Developers Conference in partnership with local and international companies.

Just like last year, the event is a free of charge, community-driven, three-days IT tech conference hosted annually in Mauritius. It’s an event full of business opportunities and professional networking. Attendees can learn about latest software development technologies, methodologies, as well as cloud features and infrastructure.

The Developers Conference is planned in partnership with other IT user groups in Mauritius.


### Details
	Date:	30 March – 1 April 2017
	Time:	09:00 hrs – ~17:30 hrs daily
	Venues:	Voila Hotel
		Flying Dodo Brewing Company
		Mall of Mauritius, Bagatelle, Mauritius

### Purpose
The aim of the conference is to provide local software developers a buffet of tools, practices and principles applicable to tackling current challenges in the Mauritian software development environment. From keeping up to date with the latest technologies and trends to tackling the challenges of working in large enterprise systems – it's a buffet of experiences, ideas and pragmatic advice as well as an opportunity to connect with peers across the industry.

When the MSCC was founded back in 2013, it quickly became clear that our tropical island had a certain lack of informational and technical events. During some monthly meetups, we spoke about this situation and that it would be very interesting and delightful to organise such an event.

Our monthly MSCC meetings are usually topic-centred and most amazingly we had solid technical information and good presenters (even though none is a professional trainer) during the last couple of month. The Developers Conference is just the consequent development of this process - our thirst for more information in the world of modern IT.

### Why sponsor the Developers Conference?
Reach out and engage with a community of IT professionals and students in IT. 

Sponsors of the Developers Conference are exposed to highly skilled tech people in Mauritius and in the region. Unlike other events, participants of the Developers Conference are generally people who craft software using a wide variety of skills that helps make the lives of people easier. 

### Attendee Profile
The event targets professional software developers who work in small to large sized organisations and who develop systems of all sizes for enterprise companies. The event aims to attract 500 to 700 attendees across industries such as financial services, web agencies, media houses, telco’s etc.

### What’s in for me?
 * Access to influential professionals
 * Internal and External networking opportunities in Mauritius and in the region.
 * Unique marketing and brand exposure
 * Opportunity to make valuable contact to make sales, and
 * Opportunity to hire talent from the IT sector

### Increase the visibility of Mauritius
Sponsorship revenue can highly increase the exposure of Mauritius by not only encouraging the local community but also helping international speakers come to speak in our Island. This also helps us learn and grow the skills of our local people by interacting with international speakers.
