                    <p>Currently most PHP frameworks are using Symfony to pave their way to this new PHP 7 era and as
                        the local community of Symfony, we are here to provide support to all developers in Mauritius
                        who want to discover and adopt the Symfony way of coding. Please feel free to come to our
                        Symfony talks and have a chat with us during the devcon. If you wish to know more about the

                    <p>Communication with your environment is an essential part of everyone's life. And it doesn't
                        matter whether you are actually living in a rural area in the middle of nowhere, within the
                        pulsating heart of a big city, or in my case on a wonderful island in the Indian Ocean. The
                        ability to exchange your thoughts, your experience and your worries with another person helps
                        you to get different points of view and new ideas on how to resolve an issue you might be
                        confronted with.</p>
                    <p>Take the chance to exchange with other attendees in the reception area or on the balcony. Have
                        some interesting conversations about software development, latest information gained during one
                        of the presentations and let others know about your ups &amp; downs in your projects.</p>
                    <p>Also, join the Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community and be part of the local IT
                        community.</p>
